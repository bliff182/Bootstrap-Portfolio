                            To everyone reading, my name is Mike, as you can see up there. I never know what to write
                            about myself in
                            these types of things so I guess I'll start with the basics. I grew up in Cranford, NJ,
                            graduated from
                            Cranford High School in 2008, and went on to graduate from Rutgers University in 2012 with a
                            degree in
                            Marketing. Naturally, that marketing degree led me to work in the field of IT, in which I
                            have worked for
                            five years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A couple of years after graduating, I moved to New York City where I have been working in a
                            helpdesk
                            position for a real estate firm. Let's get one thing straight, NYC ain't cheap, and helpdesk
                            positions don't
                            pay all that well. While I have enjoyed my employment over the years, I found myself wanting
                            to branch out
                            and expand my skillset, which led to my interest in web development. After teaching myself
                            some basics over
                            the years, I enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp with the goal of gaining the knowledge
                            and skills I
                            need to pursue a new career in web development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And now for something completely different: My hobbies include playing guitar, watching far
                            more movies and
                            TV shows than the average person, being absolutely insufferable about said movies and TV
                            shows, and yelling
                            at the TV during Devils, Giants, and Yankee games. My biggest concern with this course is
                            that hockey season
                            is about to start; I'm really hoping it doesn't significantly distract me from my coding
                            responsibilities. I
                            will certainly make every attempt to not let that happen but I'm telling you right now I
                            can't make any
                            promises.
